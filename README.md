## Data Science Projects:

### **[American Express Credit card default prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mohamedahmedx2/amex-clear-concise-eda-xgboost):**
- Credit default prediction is central to managing risk in a consumer lending business. Credit default prediction allows lenders to optimize lending decisions, which leads to a better customer experience and sound business economics. Current models exist to help manage risk. But it's possible to create better models that can outperform those currently in use.
 - **Skills:** *EDA, Financial Statistics, churn rate, Data Visualization, Decision Tree models, Feature Engineering, XGBoost*

### **[Segmentation of Jaws from CT scan images](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mohamedahmedx2/3d-jaws-segmentation-dicom-files-ai-in-medince?scriptVersionId=91454881):**
- CT scan images help doctors and specialist determain the best course of action to take considering patient heath. Convolutional neural network that specalize in segmentation can help reduce the human error and aid doctors in their observation. Segmentation of jaws into upper and lower partition is put togather in this project using state of the art deep learning techniques.
 - **Skills:** *Medical segmentation, U-net architecture, PyTorch, augmentation techniques, 3D Computer vision, deep learning*

### **[Distribution of Players by LCS Wins - League of Legends](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mohamedahmedx2/players-by-lcs-wins-league-of-legends):**
- League of Legends is one of the worldâ€™s most popular video games, developed by Riot Games. It features a team-based competitive game mode based on strategy and outplaying opponents. Each team assigns their players to different position of battleground, Does a player position impact how many trophies they can claim?
 - **Skills:** *web scrapping, data manipulation, data visualization, hypothesis testing, statistical analysis*

### **[Melanoma (Skin Cancer) Classification Using TensorFlow](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mohamedahmedx2/detecting-cancer-lesion?scriptVersionId=105356672):**
- Melanoma is a deadly disease, but if caught early, most melanomas can be cured with minor surgery. Image analysis tools that automate the diagnosis of melanoma will improve dermatologists' diagnostic accuracy. Better detection of melanoma has the opportunity to positively impact millions of people.
 - **Skills:** *Computer Vision, AI in Healthcare, TensorFlow, Binary Classification, stratifiedkfold, efficientnet*

### **[Neural Style Transfer](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mohamedahmedx2/using-ai-to-create-art-neural-style-transfer):**
- NST was first introduced in 2015 [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576) it took advantage of how convolution neural network works, The system uses neural representations to separate and recombine content and style of arbitrary images. In simple words, it transfer the style from one image to another.
 - **Skills:** *Neural networks, optimization techniques, machine learning algorithms, image manipulation*
